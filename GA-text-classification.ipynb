    "# Graded assignment 1 - text classification using Genetic Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this assignment we'll make a binary text classifier using neural networks and train it using genetic algorithms. We will classify movie reviews from IMDB as either negative or positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment text contain 3 steps, so I divided the assignment in 3 sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preprocessing of the text\n",
    "2. Genetich Algorithm\n",
    "3. Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing text**\n",
    "\n",
    "First I uploaded all data and put them together. Then I explore the dataset, explore the use of vocabulary distribution, review length distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing data I split them into training, validation and testing set. Then I preprocessed the text using different methods like removing stop words, lemmatization etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training set will be used to build vocabulary and IDF values. Validation set will be used when assigning fitness in Genetic Algorithm which I'll get into more. Testing set will be used at the end in validation part for a final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we basically doing here is to try to predict what class a text belongs to based on how many of which words the text contains. Our classifier must recognize that some words convey positive sentiment, some convey negative sentiment and some make no difference. The latter words don't help with predictions. That's why we do preprocessing and turn all the reviews into equally sized vectors representing the frequency and importance of each word which can be proceeded by our neural network. How we do the preprocessing will be further explained later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I have built two classes for preprocessing stage. One is TextPreprocessor which processes contents with methods like removing stop words, lemmatization etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other is TF-IDF vectorizer class which is used to build a Numpy array of TF-IDF vectors. Each document is turned into a TF-IDF vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genetic Algorithm**\n",
    "Genetic algorithm  (often referred as GA) is an algorithm inspired by evolution theory. Here rather than species we have solutions to a problem. We call those solutions for Chromosomes. In this case Chromosomes are just weights for a neural network. We use methods like \"cross-over\" and \"mutation\" to make changes in those Chromosomes, and we try to pick the best Chromosome. In here the best Chromosome is \n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier I used is a simple neural network. I considered decision tree, but I'm not familiar with decision trees while I'm a bit familiar with neural network. Thus I decided to go with neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "The neural net has only 2 hidden layers, 16 and 8 hidden nodes. I kept it simple because I had to take hardware limitations into account too. In early trials, this architecture seemed more than capable of learning from the training set. In the Genetic Algorithm I will train with the trainign dataset but I will calculate fitness using the validation set for each classifier. This will avoid overfitting the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing**\n",
    "The validation data is simply using the optimizied weights to predict all reviews in the testing set to see how our GA performs - that is, to determine its fitness. In the assignment text they suggested to use testing set for assigning fitness in GA and in validation part. But I thought that using the same data for GA improvement and evaluation would led to overfitting. Thus, other than training set, I used two separate sets: validation set and testing set. Validation set will be used when assigning fitness while optimizing weights in GA. Testing set will be used at the end."

    "\n",
    "Most of the functions are in this class are taken from a code posted on Canvas. I just put hem into a class, made some changes and built some additional functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing is done with a function in TextProcessor class named def `preprocess_imdb_reviews()` which uses other functions in the class. It processes all the text in a dataframe under column \"review\" and returns a dataframe with additional column named \"processed\" where all processed text are saved. I keep both of them to be able to repeat code and to make a comparison later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions are applied by using .apply() function of the dataframe, which apply a function to each row in a chosen column.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned we don't want to include all words used in the training set to be included in the vocabulary. Thus we make some changes. Here is how we process the text:\n",
    "1. We make all lower cases. Some people use upper case to highlight their words, and first letter of words are in upper case after periods. All all those words mean the same thing, so we don't want to discriminate between those. The only problem here is that movie names and person names would be processed just like some words. E.g. the movie \"Cars\" would be interpreted as noun in plural form cars, and eventually be lemmatized into car or removed. But it's very difficult to write a code to determine what is movie / person name or not, and they don't say much about whether a movie review is positive or negative. Thus for now we just ignore this problem. Lower casing all words also makes other processing steps easier.\n",
    "3. We remove HTML tags. They are not words with meaning, just some clutter to be removed.\n",
    "4. We remove URLs. They are not words with meaning, so just remove them.\n",
    "5. We convert emoticons into text. We do this before removing numbers or anything else as emoticons may contain numbers too. We don't want to remove them as they may contain useful information about the review.\n",
    "6. We remove numbers. They can be dates, ages etc. which don't give much relevant info about the review.\n",
    "7. We expand contractions. Alos \"don't\" means same as \"do not\". So we don't want to distinguish between those. Expanding contractions also will make removing stop words easier. It's important to do it early as it will generate new stop words.\n",
    "8. We remove punctuations, like dots and slashes. In computers \"something\" and \"something,\" are perceived as two different words, we don't want that.\n",
    "9. We lemmatize words. Lemmatizing means converting words to base forms.E.g. \"boring\" and \"bored\" are same words, \"child\" and \"children\" are actually same word. We want the computer to perceive them as same words too. Words with same base should be considered as same word.\n",
    "10. We remove the stop words. Words like \"the\", \"a\", \"and\" may be used in all reviews and don't give any information about review. So we just remove them.\n",
    "11. Curbing. We remove the words that exists in more than 85 % of the documents. They are some common words that don't give much context. And we remove the words that exists in less than 0.05 % of the documents. Rare words are words like special movie names, actor names, weirdo words, misspesllings etc. Words that are used only here and there or only in one review can't be used in calculating which class a reviews belongs to. The rates 0.85 and 0.0005 are paramaters to the function. I experimented with different values, I don't want to end up with vocabulary that's too little, but nor too big. Most of the words in vocabulary are rare words that are used in tiny fraction of the set. Thus the bottom curb is just 0.0005. Too little vocabulary give too little information. Too big vocabulary is too heavy for the neural network, and may contain a lot of words that give little information. A vocabulary of 10k-20k is enough. After experiemting with different values I did choose 0.85 and 0.0005 as curbing values.\n",
    "12. At the end I found some garbage words still existing in the set. I made an array of those and removed those from all the reviews. The array is: [\"□\", \"▢\", \"■\", \"\\x96\", \"st\", \"nd\", \"rd\", \"th\"]. \\x96 is just some triangle. st, nd, rd and th are remainders of numerical values like 1st, 2dn, 3rd, 4th etc. which is meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't handle emoticons. That's because I didn't find some working list of emoticons. The example linked on Canvas didn't work. And converting only some smiley emoticons into descriptive text may make the result more unbalanced. Thus I dropped converting emoticons.\n",

    "\n",
    "TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency - Ineverse Document Frequency. TF is a number that shows frequency of term in the document, in this case in a particular reveiw. IDF is calculated by: $log(\\frac{n}{1+DF})$ where N is number of documents in the Corpus, (here we use trainin set as corpus) and DF is document frequency, also number of documents that term appears in. If DF is high, the that must be a more common term, and TF of that term in the document has less weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF values are ${TF \\times IDF}$ or ${TF \\times log(\\frac{n}{1 + DF})}$ It takes into account both how much a term appears, and how unique is that term for that review.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different wasy to calculate TF-IDF values. I used this to avoud division by zero, as we add 1 in the divisor. In some websites they use 1 + n in the dividend to avoid negative values. But since we have removed all terms that apperas in more than 85 % of the documents, it's no term in the vocab appears in all documetns. So negative values of TF-IDF is not possible in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When initializing the TfIdfVectorizer class I pass in dataframe (the training set) as argument. Then using two functions (prepare_idfs and prepare_vocab) it builds two dictionaries and saves them.\n",
    "\n",
    "`self._vocab` is a dictionary where the keys are vocabulary taken from processed reviews in the training set. Also it's all the words used in the processed reviews in the training set. Values are used to determine which index TF-IDF values should be saved on. Each value in the `self._vocab` dictionary determines which index the TF-IDF value of a term in the review sohuld be be saved on.\n",
    "\n",
    "`self._idfs` is a dictionary that has same keys as `self._vocab`. But it will contain the IDF values of each term, where IDF's are based on the training set, also based on who many times that term appears in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we vectorize any text to put it into classification, we first preprocess it using functions in \"TextPreprocessor\", then we vectorize it using  `tf_idf_vectorize_all()`. That function accepts dataframe as argument. It will use .apply of the Pandas Dataframe and run `tf_idf_vectorize()` for each row in the 'processed'. Then we convert it to Numpy Array and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`tf_idf_vectorize_all()` will return a Numpy array that has an array for each review, where size of each array is equal to size of `self._vocab` or vocabulary, with TF-IDF values that saved in the indexes that represent the words in the vocab (what index for what word is determined by using `self._vocab` dictionary).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's illustration with a small example:\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple illustration let's say our corpus is very small and vocabulary has just 3 words. Then the `self._vocab` would be like:\n",
    "{\"hello\": 0, \"world\": 1, \"python\": 2}.\n",
    "\n",
    "`self._idfs` would be something similar, just it will contain IDF values. E.g. based on their frequencies, document size etc. it could be something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "{\"hello\": 0, \"world\": 0, \"python\": 0.405}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we assume the set has 8 documents. \"hello\" and \"world\" appears in 2 documents and \"python\" appears in one. So their values will be as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. if the text is \"hello hello world in python\". We will ignore the word 'in' since it's not in the `self._vocab` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see the word \"hello\" exists in the `self._vocab` and has value '0 and its IDF value is 0 in `self._idfs`. It appears two times.\n",
    "So we multiply 2 by 0, and save the value in index 0. The word \"world\" has the value '1' in the `self._vocab` dictionary, 0 in `self._idfs` dictionary, appears once in the document. So we multiply 1 by 0, and save the result in index 1. We repeat the same process for python. Then we return a Numpy array that looks like: [0, 0, 0.405]\n",
    "\n",
    "The `self._idfs` and `self._vocab` is used in the code to make the vector generation more efficient, as we don't have to generate vocabs and IDF values each time.\n",

    "### 2.2 Chromosome <a name=\"22\"></a>\n",
    "This is the Chromosome. Chromosome keeps the weights and has some methods for mutation, cross.over and fitness calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "I have written own operator functions like`__eq__`. The comparisons will be made based on value of `self.fitness`. In the GAEngine I do compare the fitness values and sort the lists, so rather than calling lambda each time I cal max() or sorte(), I did implement those functions to make the code more clean and robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chromosome has three essential functions:\n",
    "1. Assign fitness. This uses the classifier class above. It is based on accuracy after predicting the data on validation set. The goal is to increase the accuracy as much as possible.\n",
    "2. Cross over: it accepts another chromosome as parameter. New weights are produced from calculations which made based on weight values of both chromosomes (self and other). Then a new chromosome is iniitalized and returned. It's as parents give offspring to a child where childs genes are combination of parent's genes. But in this algorithm the Chromosomes has no genders, so anyone can make offspring from anyone.\n",
    "3. Mutation: here we make som random changes on the weights of the Chromosome.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I have tried 3 different cross-over methods:\n",
    "1. Single point: divide weights in two from a random index. Get the first half from first parent and second half from other parent.\n",
    "2. Multiple point: swapping multiple weight values between two chromosomes and produce offspring from them\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have two genes:\n",
    "[0.54,0.24,0.67,1.45, 0.55]\n",
    "[0.37,0.98,0,79,0.45, 0.13]\n",
    "\n",
    "Single point split can produce something like: [0.54, 0.24, 0.79, 0.45, 0.13].\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple point can produce something like: [0.54, 0.98, 0,67, 0.45, 0.13]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Uniform: New weight values that's randomly choosed between parents' weight values pluss / minus a constant 'r'. Also if weight 1_1 from parent is 0.5, weight 1_1 from other parent is 0.8. If the constant 'r' has value 0.1, then the the weight 1_1 of the offspring will be something between 0.4 and 0.9. I tried r = 0.1 but I experienced increaset 'r' to 0.4 give better results. \n",
    "\n",
    "And I have tried 3 different mutations:\n",
    "1. Choose random weights and biases, and increment or decrement their value by a range between 0 and 0.1.\n",
    "2. Assign random value between -1 and 1 to all weights and biases. That is more like resetting all values of the Chromosome.\n",
    "3. Choose some random weights and bises, assign a new value to them that's between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After experimenting, I did choose the 3rd ones: Uniform in crossover with r value 0.4. In mutation I did choose 3rd option: choosing random weights and biases and assigning them a random value between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the options can be choosen by passing a parameter to training routine of the GA Engine or to the methods.\n",

    "* To make sure if we find a very fit chromosome we don't lose it again because of cross overs or mutations. We keep them and carry them to next generations.\n",
    "* Since we know the fitness values of the chromosomes in elite, we don't run assign_fitness() function. This speeds the algorithm up. Function to assign fitness is done by prediction the whole validation set consisting of 7,500 datas. That is a heavy process. Reducing number of times we assign fitness speeds the algorithm up.\n",

But here the random choice is weighted one, also it's higher probabilty to choose chromosomes with higher fitness values. After all the cross overs the old population is thrown out and new generation is produced from the offsprings. The number of the offsprings is equal to the number of the population to avoid decrease or increase in the population. Since we keep the most fit ones in the elite list, we don't lose winners by replacing the old generation with the new geneartion.\n",

    "Even a simple neural network of 2 hidden layers with only 16-8-2 nodes using TF-IDF vectorization can classify between positive and negative IMDB movie reviews reasonably well. This was a little suprising to me as I thought since text and language is complicated such a simple network couldn't work.\n",

    "SGD converges faster maybe because it may find a local minima and fail to find global minima of the loss function.\n",
    "GA could get stuck into local minima too, but mutations are one of the methods that prevents that.\n",
    "\n",
    "But would GA outperform SGD if we had given it enough generations?\n",
    "\n",
    "One may need to run GA in 300-600 generations to see that. Even 200 generations with 100 initial population takes ca 3 hours, so testing 600 generations would take 9 hours. Not only that, one needs to test with different parameters and different cross-over and mutation methods to fine-tune  it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that so much time needs to be spent to test GA, one could rather spend that time to fine-tune with SGD.\n",
